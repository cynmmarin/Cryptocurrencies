Module 18: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

# Overview of the Analysis
In this Unsupervised Machine learning analysis there are no paired inputs and outcomes. The model that are use a whole dataset as input. This is done by transforming the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use it in another machine learning model; or by clustering or determining patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification. We will focus our attention in convincing Accountability Accountants to invest in cryptocurrency.

carefully select features that could help to find those patterns or create groups

There are two types of UML:
## Transformations
We use transformations when we need to take raw data and make it easier to understand. Transformations also can help prepare data so that it can be used for other machine learning algorithms.
## Clustering Algorithms
We use clustering algorithms to group similar objects into clusters
